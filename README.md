# Lab 1 - Machine Learning

This repository is created for the Machine Learning course.

Hello! My name is Faten Saqer.  
I'm a junior student majoring in Cybersecurity and Digital Forensics.
I'm interested in Machine Learning, especially how it can be applied to security, data analysis, and intelligent systems to detect patterns and improve decision-making.
